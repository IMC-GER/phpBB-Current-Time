# phpBB-Current-Time
This extension updates the “Current time” display every second or minute, depending on the setting. The current time is displayed on all pages and can be configured independently of the user date format in the personal settings.
The forum time is displayed. This may differ from the browser time due to different time zone settings.

You can also display the users local time in the user profile and the post authors local time in the post profile.

A world clock can be displayed above the navigation bar. This is freely configurable. Up to 6 time zones can be displayed. The settings can be made in the personal area, in the administration area and in the user administration. The time displays are continuously updated. User rights can be used to revoke the right to display the time.

These displays can be activated or deactiavted individually in the ACP for the entire forum or via the permission system for users or user groups.
