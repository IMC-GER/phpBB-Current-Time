# phpBB-Current-Time
This extension has three basic functions that can be activated independently of each other.
It's updates the current time, user local time and world clock display every second or minute, depending on the setting. These displays can be activated or deactiavted individually in the ACP for the entire forum or via the permission system for users or user groups.

The current time is displayed on all pages and can be configured independently of the user date format in the UCP personal settings.
The forum time is displayed. This may differ from the browser time due to different time zone settings.

You can also display the users local time in the user profile and the authors local time in the post and pm profile.

A world clock can be displayed above the navigation bar. This is freely configurable. Up to 6 time zones can be displayed. The settings can be made in the UCP, in the ACP and in the ACP user administration.
